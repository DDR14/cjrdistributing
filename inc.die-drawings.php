					The first thing a die maker will ask for is a drawing. Most drawings are done in AutoCAD® or SolidWorks®, but programs like Adobe® Photoshop®, Illustrator® or CorelDRAW® can also be used. Regardless of the program you use, you will need to provide a drawing that calls out every aspect of your drawing and you will need to show the location of your registration pins.</p>
